# Caesar's cipher encryption algorithm
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It shifts the characters of a text by adding a fixed value to the ASCII value of each character. Decrypting a text is simply shifting it back by the same amount.</br>
To pass an encrypted message from one person to another, it is first necessary that both parties have the *key* for the cipher, so that the sender may encrypt it and the receiver may decrypt it.</br>
